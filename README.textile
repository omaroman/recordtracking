h2. What is RecordTracking?

RecordTracking unobtrusively tracks the *creation*, *updating* and *elimination* events regarding to records.
When one of those events occurs, writes into a log:
-   The name of the action
-   The date when the action was invoked
-   The user who invoked the event
-   The name of the model
-   The model data including association id's
